# ChangeLog
## (0.0) [2018-08-24--]
- Initial tools all lacking, but found candidate for static Sh script analysis (Oil)
- Setup tooling skeleton for Travis and local with Makefile.
- Include wiki as submodule, means local vs. global URL conflict and obviously
  wiki has precedence. Maybe something to solve later, doc->wiki.
  But using file paths based on root-project in other source, outside docs/wiki repo.
