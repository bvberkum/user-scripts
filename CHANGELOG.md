# ChangeLog
Docs have their own at <doc/ChangeLog.md>
## Prototype v0
### (0.0) [2018-08-24--]
- Initial tools all lacking, but found candidate for static Sh script analysis (Oil)
- Setup tooling skeleton for Travis and local with Makefile.
- Include wiki as submodule, means local vs. global URL conflict and obviously
  wiki has precedence. Maybe something to solve later, doc->wiki.
  But using file paths based on root-project in other source, outside docs/wiki repo.
#### (0.0.2)
- Lots of rework of tooling and attempt at deduplication across
  other +U_s projects, CI and other tooling setups.
#### 0.0.1 [2018-12-15] 'lib-load'
- Initial release 'lib-load' so other repos can get testing.
