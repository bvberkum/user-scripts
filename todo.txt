2018-10-17 WIP: Initial project setup, checks, testing, SCM tools, CI.
  - Makefile to wrap tooling, prefer something agnostic but make almost always goes </Makefile>
  - May include u-s distributable later, include build tooling there.
  - Alt. compile scripts into composer, package, component JSON.
2018-10-17 TODO: get in version control [VC] lib and setup <.build/pre-commit.sh> and <.build/init.sh> properly. 
  - Will want to include checks from any library requested, whitespace, other string checking, static analysis.
