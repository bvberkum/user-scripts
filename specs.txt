2018-12-03 Overloading functions should never be unintentional.
  - Should write test-helper to check to check for this.

2018-12-03 Logging is a pain, tempted to replace it all with sentinels,
  but may want to review all profile and consolidate into env.d first.

2018-12-03 Keeping *merge history per function* maybe be useful @Backlog @Composure

  - Assume for now every function copy is identical.

    - We can identify them by a checksum of their copy
    - Also given two copies, committed in different repositories then one or the
      other can be updated automatically

  - But keeping collections of 'frozen functions' may be disadvantageous, if we
  kept each function in its own file then

    - GIT can do its merge magic
    - we can lookup the version, if any, for any given unknown copy
    (I'm not sure how to do that on subfile line basis, but is it quite simple
    for a file)
    - This is still assuming that one or the other repository will carry both
    versions; but that is the point: that merges including conflict resolutions
    are committed for known versions of the copy, and that thus for any copy of
    the version we have a 'upgrade path', a resolution to the latest edition.
    While not a literal carbon copy, each repo can maintain its own change sets.



2018-12-03 @Git baseline:
  1. TODO: see merge-history-per-function. Show how a tracked file 
    two branches same file 

                              var=foo

    test -n "$var" || var=foo           : "${var:=foo}"


    
2018-12-03 Script authors should be able to deal with a clean language.

  - Avoid variables-as-commands.

    If a command or function name in an invocation is replaced with a variable
    reference because its value is dynamic it can be wrapped by a function. Which
    is nicer to type and read.
   
    If there are namespace reasons (ie. collisions) either

    - change the load scope, ie. isolate shells
    - change the loaded scope, ie. use dynamic but predetermined namespace
    - redesign func/exec names
    - transpile
